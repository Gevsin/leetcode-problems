# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

#### Exemple

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
```

#### Constraints

```
2 <= nums.length <= 104
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
-109 <= target <= 109
Only one valid answer exists.
```

### Follow-up

Can you come up with an algorithm that is less thanÂ `O(n2)` time complexity?

### Solution

ðŸ“Œ As the array may not be sorted, we'll have to check each element until find the solution. So, the time complexity is O(n).

ðŸ“Œ We'll create an array to store the numbers. Next, in order to solve the problem, the pair for each element is: `pair = target - current`.

ðŸ“Œ The for loop goes through each element, and when we find a match, we add the indices to the `answer` vector using the `push_back` function.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
       vector<int> answer;
        for(int i=0; i<nums.size()-1; i++){
            for(int j=i+1; j<nums.size(); j++){
                if((nums[i]+nums[j])==target){
                    answer.push_back(i);
                    answer.push_back(j);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }
};

int main() {

  //vector declaration
  vector<int> nums;
  int size, e, target;

  cout << "What is the size of the vector?" << endl;
  cin >> size;

  cout << "Input the elements of the vector" << endl;

  for(int i = 0; i < size; i++){
    cin >> e;
    nums.push_back(e);
  }

  cout << "What is the target?" << endl;
  cin >> target;

  Solution obj;
  vector<int>ans = obj.twoSum(nums, target);
  for (int i = 0; i < ans.size(); i++){
    cout << ans[i] << endl;
  }


  return 0;

}

```
