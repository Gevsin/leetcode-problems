# [283. Move Zeroes](https://leetcode.com/problems/move-zeroes/)

Given an integer array `nums`, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Note** that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

#### Exemple 1

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

#### Exemple 2

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
```

#### Constraints

```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^4
-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
```

**Follow up:** Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

### Solution

ðŸ“Œ It is easy to create your own solution to this problem, take this for instance:

```cpp
void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums)
{
	for(int i=0,next=0;i<nums.size();++i)
		if(nums[i])
			swap(nums[i],nums[next++]);
}
```

ðŸ“Œ The interviewer would probably ask you to do so even if you bring up one of the other solutions I mention here, but it is also important to know your STL. An interviewer might be more impressed with this solution that uses `std::stable_parition`:

```cpp
void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums)
{
    stable_partition(begin(nums),end(nums),[](int i){return i;});
}
```

ðŸ“Œ But you can even avoid using a lambda if you know your STL extremely wellâ€”check this out:

```cpp
void moveZeroes(vector<int>& nums)
{
    stable_partition(rbegin(nums),rend(nums),logical_not<int>());
}
```

ðŸ“Œ `std::logical_not` is template function object that returns !argument for whatever is passed in. If the number is non-zero it will return false and if it is zero it will return true. This is the reverse of what the lambda does in the previous solution and so would move all the zeroes to the front, but to fix this we can just use the reverse iterators for the vector.
